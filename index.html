<p>I've never written a review for a movie before, but I'm an avid sci-fan action fan with a slant towards otherworldly concepts and ideas in films, and the Tomorrow War ticks some major boxes for me. You may recall several other films this movie pays homage towards on first viewing. It's important to see the difference between homage, and blatantly ripping off. The Tomorrow War skillfully blends its range of predecessors into a somewhat unique piece. The action sequences are gorgeous and clear, peppered with some humor while making use of excellent framing. Jokes or one-liners never seem out of place, nor do they reduce the drama of what you're seeing on screen to something silly. Also, it's been a long time since a reveal sequence got under my skin. The story wraps up nicely but there's a lot to think about or explore with potential universe building. Would recommend with popcorn and a comfy couch for a two-hour plus excite-a-thon. It's a pity that we couldn't see this in a theater cuz this story is big and loud. The clicking never stops.</p>

According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>
